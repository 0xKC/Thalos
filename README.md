## **Welcome**


Hey you! This is Thalos project speaking,  welcome to the dark side! Ops sorry, I did it again!
Never mind, welcome! ...and thank you for visiting the Thalos repository.

## **What are we doing**


### **The problem**

##### Nowadays it is rapidly increasing the need to store our files in remote to keep them easily available on multiple devices. Normally people do not have their own storage servers so they need to rely on someone who keep their files for them, thatâ€™s why services like Google Drive or Dropbox rapidly grew up in the technology market. At this point, we need to ask ourselves how much secure are this kind of services and what would happen to our files if someone seized storage servers or hacked into them. And, at least, how much it is really possible to trust in those companies? This project would propose a solution to this kind of problems: Thalos is storage service completely robust and secure by design.

 - Provide simple and secure storage in untrusted environments for everyone in the internet.
 - Provide the software so that everyone can set up his own Thalos storage system in few minutes


### **The solution**
##### This project would propose a solution to this kind of problems: Thalos is storage service completely robust and secure by design. The chosen cryptographic algorithms and the way they are applied offer to the final user the opportunity to securely store his files remotely, denying any attempt of access them without the proper authorization. Thalos design, indeed, makes it impossible for anyone who has physical or virtual access to the servers to decrypt files without the right key and neither to establish an exact match between one specific file and its owner.

 - Build a portable internet application that provides a simple management of a remote encrypted virtual filesystem.

#### **How it works**
Descriptions and diagrams will be given soon. Meanwhile you can check the pdf file of documentation in the repo.

## **Roadmap and Deadlines**


Here comes the [Roadmap](https://github.com/ecleipteon/Thalos/issues/5)
Here will come a timishtable


## **Who are we**



Founder of this project is [ecleipteon](https://www.github.com/ecleipteon),  an addicted to privacy and security and enthusiast  student of computer science and engineering from [Napoli](https://www.google.it/maps/place/Naples,+Metropolitan+City+of+Naples/@40.8538487,14.1065184,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x133b0866db7afaeb:0xd23a43cc658cb87e!8m2!3d40.8517746!4d14.2681244?dcr=0).
This project is mentored by [edovio](https://github.com/edovio) within Round 4 of the [Mozilla Open Leadership](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/) program.

## **What do we need**

**You!** Definitely!

We need expertise full stack developers, user experience, database maintenance, software sustainability, documentation and technical writing and project management. 


We need **Hardware** to deploy Thalos.


We need Security and cryptography expertise - ***Do Thalos leak informations when deals with cryptography elaborations and keys management? Are files really stored safely?***


***We need Legal consultants. What would happen if terrorists used Thalos?***



We'd love your feedback along the way, and of course, we'd love you to keep you secrets as well.

## **How can you get involved?**


If you think you can help in any of the areas listed above (and we bet you can) or in any of the many areas that we haven't yet thought of (and here we're sure you can) then please check out our contributors' guidelines and our roadmap.

Please note that it's very important to us that we maintain a positive and supportive environment for everyone who wants to participate. When you join us we ask that you follow our code of conduct in all interactions both on and offline.


## **Get in touch**


If you want to report a problem or suggest an enhancement we'd love for you to open an issue at this github repository because then we can get right on it. But you can also contact ecleipteon by email (lucamaria [DOT] castiglione [AT] gmail [DOT] com) or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ecleipteon).
